How to create and customize your own enemy units to spawn in using the TTI "Zeus" system (See Zeus tutorial text file for ref)

There are example groups on the map for each unit type; Ground, Air, Helo, Sea. Please look at them for reference.


-- CREATING YOUR CUSTOM GROUPS -- 

1) Create your own air, ground, sea or helo group to your liking within the mission editor. You can create as many of these as you want.

2) Name your group properly and take note of the group name. Each group type MUST start with the following prefixes for them to spawn correctly;

Ground Groups: "custom_ground"
Sea Groups: "custom_sea"
Air/Fixed Wing Groups: "custom_air"
Helo Groups: "custom_helo"

Again, please reference the example groups in the editor.

3) Make sure "LATE ACTIVATION" is checked on your custom group, or else the zeus spawning method will not work.

4) Save your mission.

5) Play or test flight your mission


-- SPAWNING THE CUSTOM GROUP IN GAME --

1) Create a map marker in the F10 Map

2) Type in "-create" then your custom group's name. It should start with "custom_" and then the type; ground/sea/air/helo. 
If your custom group's name was "custom_air_su30" then you would type "-create custom_air_su30"

3) Close out/remove the map marker box by hitting the red "x" button on the top right corner of the map marker box to confirm the entry.

4) Your custom group should now spawn. Enjoy!


-- TRANSFERRING YOUR CUSTOM GROUPS TO OTHER TTI MAPS OR UPDATED TTI MISSIONS

1) Multi-select groups in the mission editor by holding down SHIFT then left clicking the groups of your choice.

2) Press CTRL+C to copy the group

3) Open an updated TTI MIZ or a different TTI MAP

4) Press CTRL+V to paste the group. Ensure that the groups names didn't add a -1,-2,-3 etc if you already had a group on this map with the same name.

5) Save your mission and continue enjoying your custom groups!
