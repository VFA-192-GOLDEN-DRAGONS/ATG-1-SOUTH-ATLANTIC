Super Carrier Static Deck Spawns Menu available! - Super Carrier Maps ONLY.

Big thanks to Redkite for allowing me to add these amazing static deck layouts for the Super Carrker.

You do not have to add these template scripts in yourself, you can simply adjust the layouts using the F10 Menu to add static layouts and remove them. You can mix and match as you please in REAL TIME during the mission.

AI Helo-Troop Transport Script by 107th Rz and 107th deadlyfishes

In the settings in the mission triggers labeled as:
"AI TROOP TRANSPORT SETTINGS"

Change in qoutes which mission where you want troops to be dropped off.
NOTE: The helo will START at the MAIN AIRBASE. A2G Easy/Hard can be quite far from the main airbase. We recommend choosing A2G Inf ASsault or A2G Helo Missions.


ai_troops_transport_location = "a2g easy"

choices:
"a2g helo"
"a2g infantry assault"
"a2g easy"
"a2g hard"
"none"

CTLD Extract/Pickup DOES WORK with these troops!

______________

Call in an AI Helo-Troop Transport:
1) Place a map marker where you want droops to be dropped off.
2) Type in the map marker "drop troops here" without the qoutes.
3) CLOSE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker and watch a helo come in to drop off troops at that location!
4) command troops to do whatever you want. You can even extract/re-deploy them with CTLD.

"ZEUS" MAP MARKER SPAWNS AND COMMANDS:
You can CREATE and DESTROY units out of thin air at ANY location you choose on the F10 map, like in "Zeus" mode from ArmA 3.

Call in an AI Helo-Troop Transport:
1) Place a map marker where you want droops to be dropped off.
2) Type in the map marker "drop troops here" without the qoutes.
3) CLOSE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker and watch a helo come in to drop off troops at that location!
4) command troops to do whatever you want. You can even extract/re-deploy them with CTLD.

Create smoke marker on map marker:
1) add marker where you want to create a smoke marker
2) Type "-smoke" followed by the color smoke you want to create by using either; red, blue, white, green or orange.
3) CLOSE/REMOVE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker box.

Example: "-smoke red" will create a red smoke where you placed the map marker.

Create flare launch markers on map marker:
1) add marker where you want to create flare launches
2) Type "-flare" followed by the color smoke you want to create by using either; red, white, green or yellow.
3) CLOSE/REMOVE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker box.

Example: "-flare red" will launch red flares where you placed the map marker.

Create illumination rounds to light up an area on a map marker:
1) add marker where you want illumination rounds to be created to light up that area
2) Type "-light", "-illum" or "-illuminate" where you want the illumination rounds to be created
3) CLOSE/REMOVE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker box.

Create units:
1) Add a map marker of where you want to create a unit. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-create [NAME OF UNIT YOU WANT TO SPAWN FROM THE LIST]" DO NOT HIT ENTER OR LEAVE THE MARKER ON THE MAP JUST YET.
Example "-create red_cap_f14b" will create an element of REDFOR AI F-14's
"jtac" and "abrams" are friendly units to use combined arms with. Use the JTAC to spawn it anywhere to get a friend to control it for some fun Co-Op action!
Also, try creating your own ground attack units using the armor or infantry group spawn for an easier bulk spawn

UNITS CAN BE STACKED! Spawn as many of any unit as you like to create your own ground missions or air missions!

Tutorial here: on how to spawn units
http://www.throughtheinferno.com/wp-content/files/zeus_example.gif

(all listed are RED coalition units, using blue instead will spawn it as a blue coalition unit!)

to spawn red aav7: "-create red_ar_aav7"
to spawn blue aav7: "-create blue_ar_aav7"

NOTE: for performance reasons, you need make the debug setting "allow_blue_zeus_units" in the settings is set to true. Disable this if you are having issues with game crashes or performance.
"allow_blue_zeus_units = true"

additionally:
jtac --> (this is a MQ Drone that designates and lases targets where you place it!) (use "-create jtac")

Destroy Ground Units: (Only works for ground units):
1) Add a map marker on top of the ground units you want to destroy/delete. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-destroy" and hit the X button on the map marker (top right of the box) to rid the area of ground units or ships.

Good for: Removing missions you don't want to complete or deleting your spawned in JTAC or Friendly Combined Arms units you no longer want in your mission.
WARNING: There is no way to get back friendly ship units, you'll have to restart the mission.
